# TravelGenie Frontend

## Northcoders Software Development Final Project

Welcome to **TravelGenie**,  an app designed to simplify and enhance your travel experiences, from planning to execution.

TravelGenie was developed as our group project during the final stages of our software developer course at Northcoders. This mobile application, built using React Native, integrates various Amadeus APIs and custom backend services using Appwrite to provide a seamless travel planning experience.

A video emonstration of the app can be found [here](https://youtu.be/06qBMPb7JRI?si=ChMWZ0m4Is1TeVcK).

## Features

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. **Amadeus API:** Obtain API key for [Amadeus](https://developers.amadeus.com/) for more information watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyy26SlgBZU&t=160s).
6. **Run the App:** After configuring the APIs, run the app on your device or simulator using `npm run start`.
7. **Explore and Enjoy:** Once the app is running, explore the various features and functionalities to plan your perfect trip.

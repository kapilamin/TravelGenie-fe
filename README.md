# TravelGenie Frontend

## Northcoders Software Development Final Project

Welcome to **TravelGenie**,  an app designed to simplify and enhance your travel experiences, from planning to execution.

TravelGenie was developed as our group project during the final stages of our software developer course at Northcoders. This mobile application, built using React Native, integrates various Amadeus APIs and custom backend services using Appwrite to provide a seamless travel planning experience.
